Such approaches assume that the error-function behaves monotonically , holding steady for slow-moving sequences; however , such properties do not hold true for other kinds of movements in video sequences , which results in the risk of the algorithm getting trapped in local minima . Decreasing the computational overhead for every search point , which means the matching cost is replaced by a partial or simplified version with less complexity .
However , to our understanding , all these systems assume a contention manager module with global knowledge about the set of running transactions , which is reasonable in the context of STM; by contrast , we analyze a setting where only local , immediate , and unchangeable decisions are possible , which is the case for HTM .
However , these methods assume some labeled data in target domains and are thus not applicable in our setting of unsupervised DA .
Note , however , that for increasing angular separations , this assumption is no longer valid , and therefore , a new mathematical framework is required in order to evaluate the asymptotic performance in such cases , which is the main contribution of this paper .
However , these works all make strong assumptions on the structure of the scene , hence the types of scene they can handle in practice are limited .
However , these algorithms assume that the target speech is from a particular direction , typically right in the front in the binaural setup , and therefore may not work well when the target speech is from other directions .
However , these compositional approaches assume that word vectors have already been constructed , and contextual evidence is only used to induce optimal combination rules to derive representations of phrases and sentences .
However , this assumption usually does not hold in practical networks due to asymmetric loads on the links in two different directions or different packet scheduling strategies .
Most of these methods , however , all assume that the vehicles are distributed homogeneously over the road segment , which is not realistic .
However , these approaches rely on some strong assumptions that often lead to quasi-static *This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CNS-1552838 and the OSU M&MS Discovery Theme Initiative . 1 and unrealistic walking behaviors .
However , partial-observation supervisory controllers , as introduced in Lin and Wonham , have traditionally been designed with the assumption that the controllers are fault-free .
However , their models only consider bag-of-words assumption when modeling words in plain texts , neglecting rich textual information embedded in word order . directly builds entity representations from entity descriptions , while their model is restricted by the completeness and quality of entity descriptions .
In all these models , communication is assumed to be reliable , however .
However , these approaches are either not scalable or rely on the assumption that the third-party code is used by many apps without modification , which might not always hold true .
However , the proof techniques developed in those works assumed qubit-level systems .
The majority of these approaches , however , assumes an implicit kinematic model of the articulated object .
However , these models often rely on assumptions about the behaviour of the error: for example , they may assume that interactions are equally likely to be detected regardless of the properties of the proteins involved .
However , this assumption of omni-directional sensing ability does not hold true for some types of sensor nodes , such as cameras , ultrasonic sensors , etc . , which have a directional sensing region .
These algorithms , however , are predominantly designed with the aim of reducing the computational complexity of determinant calculation and not mitigation of the effects of its high condition number , and often rely on assumptions that do not apply to W K .
However , the IDF measure is based on a simple assumption , that a word with low semantic importance is one that is used commonly in most documents of the corpus .
However , these methods make strong assumptions about the degree to which the source categories overlap with the target domain , which limits their applicability to many real-world settings .
